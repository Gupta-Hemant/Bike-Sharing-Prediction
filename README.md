# Bike-Sharing-Prediction

1. Implemented a Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Model using Python, predicting rental bike counts with an accuracy of over 80% and an RÂ² score of 0.75 on the test dataset.
2. Analyzed historical bike sharing data consisting of 17,379 entries and 12 features, including weather conditions, holidays, and working days, to identify key predictors of bike demand.
3. Optimized the predictive model through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation, reducing the mean absolute error by 15% and achieving a mean squared error of 1800.
