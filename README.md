# Bike-Sharing-Prediction

1. Developed a predictive model for bike-sharing demand using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging various machine learning algorithms to accurately forecast bike rental usage based on historical data and environmental factors.
2. Analyzed historical bike sharing data consisting of 17,379 entries and 12 features, including weather conditions, holidays, and working days, to identify key predictors of bike demand.
3. Optimized the predictive model through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation, reducing the mean absolute error by 15% and achieving a mean squared error of 1800.
